<!-- START SUMMARY -->
In this podcast, [Quinn Slack](https://slack.org) (Sourcegraph CEO/cofounder) and [Beyang Liu](http://beyang.org) (Sourcegraph CTO/cofounder) walk through a recent Sourcegraph board meeting's slides. If you've ever wondered what startup board meetings are really like, or how we as founders work with our board, this episode is for you. In addition to sharing what's on the slides, we talk about:

- Why we never sugarcoat anything for the board
- Why it's usually bad to do extra work just for a board meeting
- Our first 2 slides in every board meeting ("Bad & good" lists, and how we're addressing the #1 bad thing)
- Why we present top 10 lists for new bookings and pipeline
- Reaffirming the latest messaging and pitches with board members
- Why we share all board slides with all Sourcegraph team members from the moment when we start creating them

You can view the [board meeting slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12Y1txpWfMzoAr_HluXm6cMDGX8cSy35F31HEwomEnjU/edit) to follow along. We've scrubbed sensitive information, including all customer names, from these public slides for obvious reasons.

This episode is an experiment. If you like it, let us know what other behind-the-scenes topics you'd like us to cover!
